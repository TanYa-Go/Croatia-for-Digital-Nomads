## Bugs found while creating the website

# Testing

## Testing was completed in the following stages: 
1. Test all code is working and passes through the validators without errors
2. Test website responsiveness across various browsers and various devices to confirm that the website is fully responsive
3. Test that all features work as intended by testing user stories
 

### 1. Code validators

[HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Returned no errors


[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Returned no errors 



### 2. Responsiveness

1. Initial tests were done using Chrome Dev Tools to make sure the website was responding properly on all screen sizes from 320px upwards
2. Then an app called [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) was used to test multiple screen sizes in one place
   
   Screen sizes tested:
    - iPhone X          
    - Pixel 2            
    - iPad              
    - Generic Laptop     
    - Moto G4           
    - Surface Duo         

3. Then I tested the following actual devices:
   - iPhone 7  
   - iPhone 11    
   - Xiaomi Pocophone F1
   - Huawei P10         
   - A1 Alpha 20+       
   - iPad
   - Lenovo Laptop G780

  Testing was done by checking the website on each device in portrait and lanscape mode, apart from the Laptop, which was cheked only in landscape mode. Making sure that each page renders correctly
 
4. The following Browsers were tested:
   - Google Chrome
   - Microsoft Edge
   - Mozilla
   - Safari
   - Opera

   Testing was done in the following manner - I opened the website url in each browser and then right clicked to open the inspector to be able to resize down 
   to the 320px, to make sure that all pages are responsive in all screen sizes.


### 3. User Stories

1. I want to be able to  navigate through the site easily to find information and services available

   Upon entering the website the user can see the navigation bar with different pages, which makes it easy to navigate the website.\
   Each menu item, when clicked, redirects to a coresponding page.\
   Logo, when clicked, leads to the "Home" page regardless of the page user is on.\
   There is a line under navbar menu item, to show the user what page they are  currently on.

2. I want to be able to see the website clearly on my mobile device

   Extensive testing was done, as described in the device testing above, to make sure that the page renders well on all screen sizes but with mobile first approach in mind.
   
 
3. I want to sign up to the newsletter to get the latest news and offers/discounts

   To sign up to the newsletter, the user can type their email address in the input field in the footer. It is available on all the pages.

## Deployment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

- A local project was created in GitHub with a new repository called 'Eleventh Embodiment'
- During the creation of the project regular commits were added which were then pushed to the GitHub website before deployment
- The project was deployed by logging in to GitHub and locating the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TanYa-Go/)
- At the top of the Repository, locate the "Settings" Button and click
- Scroll down the Settings page until the "GitHub Pages" Section was found
- Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch"
- The page will automatically refresh
- Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://tanya-go.github.io/ in the "GitHub Pages" section
- The code can be run locally through clone or download, you can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the code button and then selecting either 'clone' or 'download'
